# Re-Identification (ReID) STM32 model zoo


## Directory components:
* [datasets](docs/README_DATASETS.md) placeholder for the image re-identification datasets.
* [docs](docs/) contains all readmes and documentation specific to the image re-identification use case.
* [src](docs/README_OVERVIEW.md) contains tools to train, evaluate, benchmark, quantize and deploy your model on your STM32 target.

## Quick & easy examples:
The `operation_mode` top-level attribute specifies the operations or the service you want to execute. This may be single operation or a set of chained operations.

You can refer to readme links below that provide typical examples of operation modes, and tutorials on specific services:

- [training, chain_tqe (train + quantize + evaluate), chain_tqeb](docs/README_TRAINING.md)
- [quantization, chain_eqe, chain_qb](docs/README_QUANTIZATION.md)
- [evaluation, chain_eqeb](docs/README_EVALUATION.md)
- [benchmarking](docs/README_BENCHMARKING.md)
- [prediction](docs/README_PREDICTION.md)
- [deployment, chain_qd on STM32N6](docs/README_DEPLOYMENT_STM32N6.md)

All .yaml configuration examples are located in [config_file_examples](./config_file_examples/) folder.

The different values of the `operation_mode` attribute and the corresponding operations are described in the table below. In the names of the chain modes, 't' stands for training, 'e' for evaluation, 'q' for quantization, 'b' for benchmark and 'd' for deployment on an STM32 board.

| operation_mode attribute | Operations |
|:-------------------------|:-----------|
| `training`               | Train a model from the variety of ReID models in the model zoo **(BYOD)** or your own model **(BYOM)** |
| `evaluation`             | Evaluate the Rank-N (1, 5, 10) accuracy, and mean Average Precision (mAP) of a float or quantized model on a test dataset (query + gallery) |
| `quantization`           | Quantize a float model |
| `prediction`             | Predict the identities of the individuals in the input images of a float or quantized ReID model |
| `benchmarking`           | Benchmark a float or quantized model on an STM32 board |
| `deployment`             | Deploy a model on an STM32 board |
| `chain_tqeb`             | Sequentially: training, quantization of trained model, evaluation of quantized model, benchmarking of quantized model |
| `chain_tqe`              | Sequentially: training, quantization of trained model, evaluation of quantized model |
| `chain_eqe`              | Sequentially: evaluation of a float model,  quantization, evaluation of the quantized model |
| `chain_qb`               | Sequentially: quantization of a float model, benchmarking of quantized model |
| `chain_eqeb`             | Sequentially: evaluation of a float model,  quantization, evaluation of quantized model, benchmarking of quantized model |
| `chain_qd`               | Sequentially: quantization of a float model, deployment of quantized model |

There is no model_type on the ReID use case, but [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/blob/master/re-identification/README.md) can be found the list of the available models.

## You don't know where to start? You feel lost?
Don't forget to follow our tuto below for a quick ramp up : 
* [How can I define and train my own model?](docs/tuto/how_to_define_and_train_my_own_model.md)
* [How can I fine tune a pretrained model on my own dataset?](docs/tuto/how_to_finetune_a_model_zoo_model_on_my_own_dataset.md)
* [How can I check the accuracy after quantization of my model?](docs/tuto/how_to_compare_the_performance_after_quantization_of_my_model.md)
* [How can I evaluate my model on STM32N6 target?](docs/tuto/how_to_evaluate_my_model_on_stm32n6_target.md)

Remember that minimalistic yaml files are available [here](./config_file_examples/) to play with specific services, and that all pre-trained models in the [STM32 model zoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/) are provided with their configuration .yaml file used to generate them. These are very good starting points to start playing with!
