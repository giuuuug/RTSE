# Overview of Re-Identification STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several models for re-identification use cases pre-trained on public datasets. Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `Public_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains public re-identification models trained on public datasets.
- `ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains different re-identification models trained on various public datasets following the [training section](./README_TRAINING.md) in STM32 model zoo.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/main/re_identification).**

You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
