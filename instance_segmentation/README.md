# Instance segmentation STM32 model zoo

## Directory Components:
* [datasets](docs/README_DATASETS.md) placeholder for the instance segmentation datasets.
* [docs](docs/) contains all readmes and documentation specific to the instance segmentation use case.
* [src](docs/README_OVERVIEW.md) contains tools to do predictions, benchmark or deployment of your model on your STM32 target.

## Quick & easy examples:
The `operation_mode` top-level attribute specifies the operations or the service you want to execute. This may be single operation or a set of chained operations.

You can refer to readme links below that provide typical examples of operation modes, and tutorials on specific services:

   - [benchmarking](./docs/README_BENCHMARKING.md)
   - [prediction](./docs/README_PREDICTION.md)
   - [deployment](./docs/README_DEPLOYMENT_STM32N6.md)

All .yaml configuration examples are located in [config_file_examples](./config_file_examples/) folder.

The different values of the `operation_mode` attribute and the corresponding operations are described in the table below:

| operation_mode attribute | Operations |
|:---------------------------|:-----------|
| `prediction`   | Predict the classes some images belong to using a float or quantized model |
| `benchmarking` | Benchmark a float or quantized model on an STM32 board |
| `deployment`   | Deploy a model on an STM32 board |

The `model_type` attributes currently supported for the instance segmentation are:
- `yolov8n_seg` : is an advanced instance segmentation model from Ultralytics that builds upon the strengths of its predecessors in the YOLO series. It is designed for real-time segmentation, offering high IoU and speed. It incorporates state-of-the-art techniques such as improved backbone networks, better feature pyramid networks, and advanced anchor-free detection heads, making it highly efficient for various computer vision tasks.


## You don't know where to start? You feel lost?
Don't forget to follow our tuto below for a quick ramp up : 
* [How can I deploy an Ultralytics Yolov8 instance segmentation model?](./docs/tuto/How_to_deploy_yolov8_instance_segmentation.md)

Remember that minimalistic yaml files are available [here](./config_file_examples/) to play with specific services, and that all pre-trained models in the [STM32 model zoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/) are provided with their configuration .yaml file used to generate them. These are very good starting points to start playing with!
