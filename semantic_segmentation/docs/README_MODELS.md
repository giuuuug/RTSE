# Overview of semantic segmentation STM32 model zoo

The STM32 model zoo includes several models for semantic segmentation use cases pre-trained on custom and public datasets. Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

`ST_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains all the semantic segmentation models for this use case, trained on various public datasets following the [training section](./README_TRAINING.md) in STM32 model zoo.

**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/semantic_segmentation/).**



You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
