# How can I finetune a ST Model Zoo model on my own dataset?

With ST Model Zoo, you can easily pick an already pretrained model and finetune it on your own dataset.

## Pick a pretrained model

A choice of model architectures pretrained on multiple dataset can be found [here](../README_MODELS.md).
Find the model you would like to based on it's input size and performance on various benchmarks.

## Finetune the model on my dataset

To retrain the model we edit the user_config.yaml and the stm32ai_main.py python script (both found in /src).
In this example, we retrain the mobilenet_v2 model with an input size of (416x416x3) pretrained on a large public dataset imagenet, with our data.
We used the [Pascal VOC 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) dataset. 


## Operation modes:

Depending on what you want to do, you can use the operation modes below:
- Training:
    - To simply train the model on my data and get as output the trained tensorflow model (.h5).
- Chain_tqe:
    - To train, quantize and evaluate the model in one go. You get as ouput both the train and quantized trained models (.h5 and .tflite)
- Chain_tqeb:
    - To train, quantize, evaluate and benchmark the quantized model in one go.

For any details regarding the parameters of the config file, you can look here:
- [Training documentation](../README_TRAINING.md)
- [Quantization documentation](../README_QUANTIZATION.md)
- [Benchmark documentation](../README_BENCHMARKING.md)
- [Evaluation documentation](../README_EVALUATION.md)


The most important parts here are to define:
- The operation mode to training
- The data paths
- Define which and how many classes you want to detect
- Choose a model, its pretrained weights and input size
- The other training parameters

For the Chain_tqe and Chain_tqeb operation modes, you need to edit the config file to add parts related to the quantization and benchmark.
Look at the documentation linked above for more details.

You can also find examples of user_config.yaml for any operation mode [here](../../config_file_examples)

## Run the script:

Edit the user_config.yaml then open a terminal (make sure to be in the UC folder). Finally, run the command:

```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py
```
You can also use any .yaml file using command below:
```powershell
python stm32ai_main.py --config-path=path_to_the_folder_of_the_yaml --config-name=name_of_your_yaml_file
```
