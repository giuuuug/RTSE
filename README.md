# STMicroelectronics – STM32 model zoo services

Welcome to STM32 model zoo services!

**🎉 We are excited to announce that the STM32 AI model zoo now includes comprehensive PyTorch support, joining TensorFlow and ONNX.
It now features a vast library of PyTorch models, all seamlessly integrated with our end-to-end workflows. Whether you want to train, evaluate, quantize, benchmark, or deploy, you’ll find everything you need – plus the flexibility to choose between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX. Dive into the expanded <a href="https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/">STM32 model zoo</a> and take your AI projects further than ever on STM32 devices.**

---


The STM32 AI model zoo is a set of services and scripts used to ease end to end AI models integration on ST devices. This can be used in conjunction with the [STM32 model zoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/), which contains a collection of reference machine learning models optimized to run on STM32 microcontrollers.
Available on GitHub, it is a valuable resource for anyone looking to add AI capabilities to their STM32-based projects.

- Scripts to easily retrain or fine-tune any model from user datasets (BYOD and BYOM)
- A set of services and chained services to quantize, benchmark, predict, and evaluate any model (BYOM)
- Application code examples automatically generated from user AI models

These models can be useful for quick deployment if you are interested in the categories they were trained on. We also provide training scripts to perform transfer learning or to train your own model from scratch on your custom dataset.

The performance on reference STM32 MCUs and MPUs is provided for both float and quantized models.
This project is organized by application. For each application, you will have a step-by-step guide indicating how to train and deploy the models.

To clone the repository please use:

```bash

## Available use-cases
The ST model zoo provides a collection of independent `services` and pre-built `chained services` that can be used to perform various functions related to machine learning. The individual services include tasks such as training or quantization of a model, while the chained services combine multiple services to perform more complex functions, such as training the model, quantizing it, and evaluating the quantized model successively before benchmarking it on a HW of your choice.

**All trained models in the [STM32 model zoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/) are provided with their configuration .yaml file used to generate them. This is a very good baseline to start with!**

## <a id="SemSeg">Semantic Segmentation</a>
Semantic segmentation is an algorithm that associates a label to every pixel in an image. It is used to recognize a collection of pixels that form distinct categories. It doesn't differentiate instances of the same category, which is the main difference between instance and semantic segmentation.

## <a id="STM32 Docker Image">STM32 model zoo Docker Image</a>

A Docker-based setup is available for the STM32AI Model Zoo, including a ready-to-use image that captures the full software stack (tools, dependencies, and configuration) in a single, consistent environment. This Docker configuration reduces host-specific installation and compatibility issues, and offers a straightforward way to run the project on different platforms with identical behavior. It also makes it easier to share and reproduce workflows, whether training, evaluating, or running experiments, by keeping the runtime environment standardized across machines.

## <a id="Hugging Face">Hugging Face host</a>
The Model Zoo Dashboard is hosted in a Docker environment under the [STMicroelectronics Organization](https://huggingface.co/STMicroelectronics). This dashboard is developed using Dash Plotly and Flask, and it operates within a Docker container.
It can also run locally if Docker is installed on your system. The dashboard provides the following features:

•	Training: Train machine learning models.
•	Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of models.
•	Benchmarking: Benchmark your model using ST Edge AI Developer Cloud
•	Visualization: Visualize model performance and metrics.
•	User Configuration Update: Update and modify user configurations directly from the dashboard.
•	Output Download: Download model results and outputs.

You can also find our models on Hugging Face under the [STMicroelectronics Organization](https://huggingface.co/STMicroelectronics). Each model from the STM32AI Model Zoo is represented by a model card on Hugging Face, providing all the necessary information about the model and linking to dedicated scripts.


## Before you start
For a detailed guide on installing and setting up the model zoo and its requirements, especially when operating behind a proxy in a corporate environment, refer to the wiki article [How to install STM32 model zoo](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/index.php?title=AI:How_to_install_STM32_model_zoo).

* Create an account on myST and sign in to [STEdgeAI Developer Cloud](https://stedgeai-dc.st.com/home) to access the service.
* Alternatively, install [STEdgeAI Core](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html) locally and obtain the path to the `stm32ai` executable.
* If using a GPU, install the appropriate GPU driver. For NVIDIA GPUs, refer to the [CUDA and cuDNN installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html). On Windows, for optimal GPU training performance, avoid using WSL. If using conda, see below for installation.
  to https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html to install CUDA and CUDNN. On Windows, it is
  not recommended to use WSL to get the best GPU training acceleration. If using conda, see below for installation.
* For Docker-based execution of the Model Zoo, see [README.md](./docker/README.md).
* Python **3.12.9** is required. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    * On Windows, ensure the **Add python.exe to PATH** option is selected during installation.
    * On Windows, if you plan to use the `pesq` library (for speech quality evaluation), you must have Visual Studio with C++ build tools installed. Download from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).


Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services.git --depth 1
cd stm32ai-modelzoo-services
```

Create a Python environment using either venv or conda:

- With venv:
  ```
  python -m venv st_zoo
  ```
- With conda:
  ```
  conda create -n st_zoo python=3.12.9
  ```

Activate your environment:

- venv (Windows):
  ```
  st_zoo\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```
- venv (Unix/Mac):
  ```

  ```
  conda activate st_zoo
  ```

If using an NVIDIA GPU with conda, install CUDA libraries and set the path:
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.8 cudnn
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/' > $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
```

Then install all required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Initialize Git Submodules

Some application code in this repository is provided as git submodules. These submodules contain essential code for specific use cases and are not included in the main repository by default. To ensure all features and application examples work correctly, you need to initialize and update the submodules after cloning the repository:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This command will download all necessary submodules content, it is only needed if you plan to use deployment features.
## Practical Notes

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> [stm32ai-tao](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-tao) is a  GitHub repository provides Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to manage a complete life cycle of a model from training, to compression, optimization and benchmarking using **NVIDIA TAO Toolkit** and STEdgeAI Developer Cloud.

> [!CAUTION]
> If there are any white spaces in the paths (for Python, STM32CubeIDE, or STEdgeAI Core local installation), this can result in errors. Avoid having paths with white spaces.

> [!TIP]
> In this project, we are using the ClearML library to log the results of different runs.

### ClearML Setup

1. **Sign Up**: Sign up for free to the [ClearML Hosted Service](https://app.clear.ml). Alternatively, you can set up your own server as described [here](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/deploying_clearml/).

2. **Create Credentials**: Go to your ClearML workspace and create new credentials.

3. **Configure ClearML**: Create a `clearml.conf` file and paste the credentials into it. If you are behind a proxy or using SSL portals, add `verify_certificate = False` to the configuration to make it work. Here is an example of what your `clearml.conf` file might look like:

    ```ini
    api {
        web_server: https://app.clear.ml
        api_server: https://api.clear.ml
        files_server: https://files.clear.ml
        # Add this line if you are behind a proxy or using SSL portals
        verify_certificate = False
        credentials {
            "access_key" = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
            "secret_key" = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
        }
    }

    ```

Once configured, your experiments will be logged directly and shown in the project section under the name of your project.

### MLflow Setup

In this project, we are also using the MLflow library to log the results of different runs.

#### Windows Path Length Limitation

Depending on which version of Windows OS you are using or where you place the project, the output log files might have a very long path, which might result in an error at the time of logging the results. By default, Windows uses a path length limitation (MAX_PATH) of 256 characters. To avoid this potential error, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Long Paths**: Create (or edit) a variable named `LongPathsEnabled` in the Registry Editor under `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem` and assign it a value of `1`. This will change the maximum length allowed for the file path on Windows machines and will avoid any errors resulting due to this. For more details, refer to [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file).

2. **GIT Configuration**: If you are using Git, the line below may help solve the long path issue:

    ```bash
    git config --system core.longpaths true
    ```
