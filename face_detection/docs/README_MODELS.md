# Overview of Face Detection STM32 model zoo


The STM32 model zoo includes several models for Face Detection use case pre-trained on custom and public datasets.
Under each model directory, you can find the following model categories:

- `Public_pretrainedmodel_public_dataset` contains public Face Detection models trained on public datasets.


**Feel free to explore the model zoo and get pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo/tree/master/face_detection/).**


You can get footprints and performance information for each model following links below:
